# rBRIC

## Overview
This software provides a biclustering module for gene expression data, 
including microarray and RNA-seq data. For a set of genes and a set of 
conditions, the program outputs a block-like structure which shows uniform 
pattern within the block, the block would contain only subsets of all given 
genes under subsets of all given conditions. 

Certain parts of the code uses open-source data structure library codes, 
including:

* [Mark A. Weiss's data structure codes](http://www.cs.fiu.edu/~weiss/)


## Installation
*TBD*
